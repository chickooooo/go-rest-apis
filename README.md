# go-rest-apis

* This repo is a minimal exploration of Go’s **`net/http`** package and the **Routing Enhancements introduced in Go 1.22+**.
* It serves as a sandbox to test how the new native routing features fit into REST API development.

### What's inside

* `main.go` — entry point and routes definition
* `handler.go` — request handlers for different endpoints
* `go.mod` / `go.sum` — module dependencies

### Goals

* Explore native routing improvements in Go 1.22+
* Understand maintainability and clarity for small REST APIs
* Test request/response handling patterns with `net/http`

### Usage

```bash
go run .
```
