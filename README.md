# go-rest-apis

* This repo is a minimal exploration of Go’s **`net/http`** package and the **Routing Enhancements introduced in Go 1.22+**.
* It serves as a sandbox to test how the new native routing features fit into REST API development.
* It also explores how to implement **JWT (JSON Web Token)** and use it to protect routes.

### What's inside

* `main.go`: entry point and routes definition
* `handler.go`: request handlers for different endpoints
* `model.go`: model definition
* `jwt.go`: JWT creation and verification
* `go.mod` / `go.sum` — module dependencies

### Usage

```bash
go run .
```
